# Modelling-cryptocurrencies-volatility
# Abstract
> In this article, we use extended models of the HAR-RV family, adding CBOE Gold Volatility Index (GVZ), CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index (OVX), CBOE DJIA Volatility Index (VXD) and CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) to them to predict the volatility of Bitcoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin. Using the Model confidence set procedure, we found that gold volatility increases the predictive accuracy of models when forecasting a day ahead, and the variables GVZ, VXD, VIX increase the predictive accuracy of models when forecasting a month ahead for these cryptocurrencies.
**Keywords**: HAR-RV, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, realized volatility
